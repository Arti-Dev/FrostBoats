# FrostBoats
Boats, but with Frost Walker so you can boat over lakes of ice instead of water.

# How-to
There are two ways to create Frost Boats.
- Crafting them with two powder snow buckets, three snow blocks, and of course a boat
- Combining a boat with a Frost Walker book in an anvil
Boats crafted with crafting tables have limited durability, while boats born from anvils have infinite durability.

You can also disable the plugin's crafting table recipes or anvil recipes with the config file.

FrostBoats can be placed directly on water or can be placed on land first - they act the same as Frost Walker.

The radius of the water freezed is affected by the level of Frost Walker applied to the boat. The maximum radius is 14.9.

When in a FrostBoat, an actionbar pops up displaying how much durability is left. 
Once this number hits zero, the boat turns into a regular boat and no longer can freeze water until re-crafted.

Many values such as durability, base anvil cost, and default Frost Walker level are configurable in the config file.

This plugin is best run on optimized server softwares such as Paper, as server lag can cause these boats to bug out sometimes.
